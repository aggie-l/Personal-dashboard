# Personal-dashboard üßû‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Scrimba Frontend Developer Path project 

Personal dashboard was created as part of exercises to practice working with APIs and Async JavaScript.
It was designed as optional Chrome extension.

Several APIs I have used here are Unsplash (fetching background images), CoinGecko API (fetching information on Monero highs and lows),
Weather API (working with geolocation: latitude and longitude to acquire current location),
and Random Quotes API.

Topics covered:
- Clients / Servers
- Request / Response cycle
- fetch / .then() / .catch()
- Requests (methods, headers, body, URL)
- REST API design (params, query)
- Async JavaScript (callbacks, promises, async/await)
